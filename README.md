# elm-lunch-picker

This repo contains a small proof-of-concept front-end for lunch-picker.
Primarily, lunch-picker is meant to be used as a Slack slash command, but
this little Elm page provides an alternate front-end.

Note that this page does not allow for access to any of the user veto
features that the Slack command allows. Honestly, this was mostly just me
wanting to play around with Elm.
